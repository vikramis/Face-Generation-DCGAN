# Face-Generation-DCGAN

Project Overview
This repository show cases the fourth project on Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DC GAN) project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree.
The project has been review and meets specifications. I am continuously trying to improve on suggestions to generate a higher resolution image without checker board patterns.

The DCGAN, generates new faces, based on a downsampled celebrity image data set. The network architecture is similar to the originally proposed DCGAN architecture[1].

Getting started
Open the dlnd_face_generation.ipynb on a GPU enabled Python notebook environment. The notebook consists of steps in the cells that detail dataloaders to class definitions and training loops for the Discriminator and Generator.
Run the cells in the notebook to generate your own unique and random face images.
